# Security audit and enhanced test coverage for git analysis module

## Context
Perform comprehensive security audit of the git analysis module (backend-002) and enhance test coverage to ensure robust security practices. The git analysis module handles external Git repository data and commit parsing, which requires careful security validation.

## Objectives
- Conduct security audit of git analysis module for vulnerabilities
- Enhance test coverage to include security edge cases
- Ensure safe handling of Git repository data and commit messages
- Validate input sanitization and injection protection
- Review for potential denial-of-service vectors

## Tasks
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Review git analysis code for vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Analyze Git repository access patterns for path traversal risks
  - [ ] Review commit message parsing for injection vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Check regex patterns for ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service)
  - [ ] Validate error handling to prevent information leakage
  - [ ] Review memory usage patterns for potential DoS vectors
- [ ] **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Add security-focused tests
  - [ ] Test malicious commit messages with injection attempts
  - [ ] Test oversized repository scenarios for memory limits
  - [ ] Test malformed Git data handling
  - [ ] Test path traversal attempts in repository operations
  - [ ] Test regex catastrophic backtracking scenarios
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document security considerations
  - [ ] Create security guidelines for git analysis usage
  - [ ] Document safe repository access patterns
  - [ ] Add security warnings for production deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Security Audit Complete:**
- No high or critical security vulnerabilities identified
- All identified issues documented with mitigation strategies
- Security review report generated with findings

✅ **Test Coverage Enhanced:**
- Additional security-focused tests added to tests/ directory
- All security edge cases covered with passing tests
- Test suite includes malicious input handling validation

✅ **Documentation Updated:**
- Security considerations documented in CLAUDE.md
- Safe usage guidelines provided for production deployment
- Threat model documented for git analysis features

## Technical Notes
- Use security-auditor agent for comprehensive vulnerability assessment
- Focus on Git repository interaction safety (git2 crate usage)
- Review regex patterns in extract_task_ids for ReDoS vulnerabilities
- Validate commit message parsing for script injection risks
- Consider repository size limits and memory usage constraints
- Ensure proper error handling without information disclosure

## Updates
- 2025-09-21: Task created
- 2025-09-21: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive security audit and enhanced test coverage implemented
  - Created detailed security report (`security-report.md`) identifying 8 vulnerabilities
  - Implemented 17 security-focused tests in `tests/security_tests.rs`
  - Added security documentation to `CLAUDE.md`
  - Validated ReDoS, path traversal, injection, and memory exhaustion protections
  - All acceptance criteria met
