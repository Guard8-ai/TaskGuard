# Phase 2-3 Release and Distribution Strategy

## Context
After implementing intelligence features and Claude Code integration, TaskGuard needs a proper release strategy for distribution and user adoption.

## Objectives
- Prepare TaskGuard for public release
- Create distribution packages
- Set up release automation
- Document deployment procedures

## Tasks
- [x] ~~Set up GitHub releases with binaries~~ (Deferred to deployment-002)
- [x] Create installation scripts
- [x] ~~Package for major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)~~ (Source-based installation implemented)
- [x] ~~Set up automated builds with GitHub Actions~~ (Deferred to deployment-002)
- [x] ~~Create Homebrew formula~~ (Deferred - requires public binaries)
- [x] ~~Consider cargo install packaging~~ (Deferred to deployment-002)
- [x] Write deployment documentation
- [x] ~~Create version management strategy~~ (Basic versioning in place)
- [x] ~~Set up changelog automation~~ (Deferred to deployment-002)
- [x] ~~Plan beta testing program~~ (Internal testing complete)

## Completed Work

### ✅ Installation Scripts Created
- **Linux**: `scripts/install-linux.sh` - Full dependency checking, build, and global installation
- **macOS**: `scripts/install-macos.sh` - System-wide installation with permission handling
- **Windows**: `scripts/install-windows.ps1` - PowerShell script with environment detection
- **WSL/WSL2**: `scripts/install-wsl.sh` - Optimized for Windows Subsystem for Linux

### ✅ Documentation Completed
- **INSTALL.md**: Comprehensive installation guide for private repository
- **README.md**: Updated with installation instructions and current feature status
- **Platform-specific notes**: Detailed troubleshooting and platform considerations

### ✅ Repository Setup
- **Private GitHub repository**: https://github.com/Guard8-ai/TaskGuard
- **Git integration**: Full repository with all source code and documentation
- **Access control**: Proper private repository setup for Guard8.ai organization

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Distribution:**
- ✅ Source-based installation process documented and tested
- ✅ Easy installation process for all major platforms
- ✅ Multiple installation methods available (manual + scripted)

✅ **Documentation:**
- ✅ Clear installation instructions for private repository access
- ✅ Platform-specific guides and troubleshooting
- ✅ Comprehensive user documentation

⏳ **Automation:** (Moved to deployment-002)
- ⏳ Automated builds and releases
- ⏳ Version bumping and changelog generation
- ⏳ Quality checks before release

## Technical Notes
- Source-based installation approach chosen for private repository
- Cross-platform compatibility achieved through Rust's portability
- Installation scripts handle dependency checking and PATH configuration
- Private repository access requires Guard8.ai organization membership
