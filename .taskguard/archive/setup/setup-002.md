# Update Documentation

## Context
The TaskGuard documentation needs to be updated to reflect the completed Phase 1 implementation. The current CLAUDE.md and design documents need to accurately describe the working features and provide clear usage examples.

## Objectives
- Update CLAUDE.md with accurate implementation status
- Add comprehensive usage examples
- Document the working CLI commands
- Provide clear getting started guide
- Update the design document with lessons learned

## Tasks
- [x] Add build and installation instructions to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Document all working CLI commands with examples
- [x] Create a "Quick Start" section
- [x] Update implementation status to reflect Phase 1 completion
- [x] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [x] Document task file format with examples
- [x] Add dependency management examples
- [x] Create README.md with comprehensive getting started guide
- [x] Document configuration options
- [x] Add examples of multi-area project organization

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Complete Documentation:**
- All implemented features are documented with examples
- Build and installation instructions are clear
- Quick start guide gets users productive in under 5 minutes

✅ **Accurate Status:**
- Implementation status reflects actual working features
- Future roadmap is clearly separated from current capabilities
- No outdated or incorrect information

✅ **Usability:**
- Documentation includes real command examples
- Common use cases are covered
- Troubleshooting guidance is provided

## Technical Notes
- Focus on the actually implemented features (init, list, create, validate)
- Include actual command output examples from testing
- Document the YAML front-matter format requirements
- Explain the dependency blocking system with examples
- Keep the design philosophy prominent but separate from usage docs

## Updates
- 2025-09-21: Task created
- 2025-09-21: Documentation completed - all features documented with examples, build instructions, troubleshooting, and comprehensive README.md created
