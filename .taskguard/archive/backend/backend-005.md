# Add test creation and commit reminders to task template

## Context
Current task template in src/commands/create.rs lacks reminders for essential development practices like test creation and committing changes. Need to add general reminders (not platform-specific) to encourage TDD and proper version control.

## Objectives
- Add test creation reminders to task template
- Add commit change reminders to task workflow
- Keep reminders general and platform-agnostic
- Improve development workflow integration

## Tasks
- [x] Review current template format in src/commands/create.rs:59-88
- [x] Add "## Testing" section with general test creation reminders
- [x] Add "## Version Control" section with commit reminders
- [x] Update template string to include new sections
- [x] Test new template by creating sample tasks
- [x] Verify template renders correctly in generated task files

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Template Updated:**
- New tasks include "## Testing" section with test creation reminders
- New tasks include "## Version Control" section with commit reminders
- Template remains platform-agnostic (no specific frameworks mentioned)

✅ **Content Quality:**
- Test reminders encourage writing tests before marking tasks complete
- Commit reminders encourage regular commits and meaningful messages
- Sections integrate naturally with existing template structure

## Technical Notes
- Modify the template string in src/commands/create.rs around line 59
- Add sections after "## Technical Notes" but before "## Updates"
- Example additions:
  - "## Testing: Create tests for this implementation before marking complete"
  - "## Version Control: Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages"

## Updates
- 2025-09-28: Task created
- 2025-09-29: Template updated with Testing and Version Control sections, tested and verified working
