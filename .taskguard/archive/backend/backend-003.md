# Implement Task Complexity and Lint Analysis

## Context
TaskGuard needs intelligent analysis of task files to detect complexity issues, suggest improvements, and warn about potential problems before they become blockers.

## Objectives
- Analyze task file complexity and structure
- Detect overly complex tasks that should be broken down
- Provide linting suggestions for task quality
- Implement `taskguard lint` command

## Tasks
- [x] Create task file analysis engine
- [x] Implement complexity scoring algorithms
- [x] Add task structure validation
- [x] Build recommendation system for task breakdown
- [x] Implement `taskguard lint` command
- [x] Add configurable linting rules
- [x] Create task quality metrics
- [x] Add warnings for common anti-patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Complexity Analysis:**
- Accurately scores task complexity based on multiple factors
- Identifies tasks that are too large/complex
- Suggests natural breakdown points

✅ **Lint Command:**
- `taskguard lint` analyzes all tasks for issues
- Provides actionable improvement suggestions
- Shows task quality metrics and scores

✅ **Quality Improvements:**
- Detects missing information in tasks
- Suggests better task structure
- Warns about dependency issues

## Technical Notes
- Analyze factors: line count, checkbox count, estimated time, dependencies
- Use configurable thresholds for complexity warnings
- Provide specific suggestions (e.g., "Consider breaking into setup and implementation tasks")
- Ensure fast analysis even with hundreds of tasks
- Make rules configurable via .taskguard/config.toml

## Updates
- 2025-09-21: Task created for Phase 2 development
- 2025-09-21: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Task complexity and lint analysis fully implemented
  - Created comprehensive analysis module with complexity scoring algorithms
  - Implemented `taskguard lint` command with verbose and area filtering options
  - Added task structure validation and quality metrics
  - Built recommendation system for task breakdown suggestions
  - Added configurable thresholds for complexity warnings
  - Implemented 10 comprehensive tests covering all analysis functionality
  - All acceptance criteria met: complexity analysis, lint command, and quality improvements
