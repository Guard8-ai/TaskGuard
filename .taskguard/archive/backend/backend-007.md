# Enhance sync command with remote collaboration support

## Context
The current `taskguard sync` command analyzes local Git history to suggest task status updates based on commit activity. However, teams working collaboratively need the ability to synchronize task states across multiple repositories and developers. This enhancement will add remote synchronization capabilities to enable team collaboration while maintaining TaskGuard's local-first philosophy.

**Current State:**
- `taskguard sync` only analyzes local Git commits
- Task updates are manually applied by individual developers
- No mechanism for teams to share task progress across repositories
- Risk of conflicting task states between team members

**Team Collaboration Need:**
- Multiple developers working on shared TaskGuard projects
- Synchronize task statuses across team members' local repositories
- Maintain consistency of task states during collaborative development
- Enable remote teams to coordinate task progress effectively

## Objectives
- Add `--remote` flag to sync command for fetching updates from remote repository
- Implement conflict resolution for divergent task states between local and remote
- Preserve local-first approach while enabling team synchronization
- Provide clear feedback on sync operations and potential conflicts
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing sync functionality

## Tasks
- [ ] Examine current `taskguard sync` implementation and Git integration
- [ ] Design remote sync architecture that respects local-first principles
- [ ] Add `--remote` flag to sync command CLI interface
- [ ] Implement remote repository fetching and analysis
- [ ] Create conflict detection for divergent task states
- [ ] Design conflict resolution strategies (merge, overwrite, interactive)
- [ ] Add remote sync status reporting and user feedback
- [ ] Implement dry-run mode for safe remote sync preview
- [ ] Add configuration options for remote sync behavior
- [ ] Handle authentication and repository access edge cases
- [ ] Create comprehensive error handling for network and access issues
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running sync operations

## Acceptance Criteria
âœ… **Remote Sync Functionality:**
- `taskguard sync --remote` fetches and analyzes remote repository changes
- Command detects task-related commits from all team members since last sync
- Provides suggestions for task status updates based on remote activity
- Shows clear diff between local and remote-suggested task states

âœ… **Conflict Resolution:**
- Detects when local and remote suggest different statuses for same task
- Offers resolution options: accept remote, keep local, or manual review
- Preserves user choice and doesn't force automatic overwrites
- Provides clear rationale for each suggested change

âœ… **Team Collaboration:**
- Multiple team members can run sync and get consistent suggestions
- Recent changes from all contributors are analyzed and surfaced
- Team progress is visible across individual developer environments
- Maintains task state consistency across collaborative workflows

âœ… **Safety and Control:**
- Dry-run mode shows what would change without applying updates
- User confirmation required before applying remote-suggested changes
- Rollback capability for sync operations
- Clear logging of all sync actions for audit trail

## Technical Notes
- Build on existing Git analysis infrastructure in `src/git.rs`
- Add remote repository operations using `git2` crate
- Implement smart fetching to avoid unnecessary network operations
- Consider caching remote analysis results for performance
- Design conflict resolution UI/UX for terminal interaction
- Handle various Git authentication methods (SSH, HTTPS, tokens)
- Support different remote repository structures and branch strategies
- Maintain compatibility with existing `GitAnalyzer` implementation

**Remote Sync Architecture:**
1. **Fetch Phase**: Update local tracking branches from remote
2. **Analysis Phase**: Analyze remote commits not present in local analysis
3. **Comparison Phase**: Compare remote suggestions with local task states
4. **Resolution Phase**: Present conflicts and options to user
5. **Application Phase**: Apply accepted changes with user confirmation

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
- **No Conflict**: Remote suggestion matches local state â†’ No action needed
- **Local Ahead**: Local has changes not reflected in remote â†’ Inform user
- **Remote Ahead**: Remote has changes not reflected locally â†’ Suggest update
- **Divergent**: Both local and remote suggest different states â†’ Interactive resolution

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for remote repository fetching and analysis
- [ ] Create integration tests with mock remote repositories
- [ ] Test conflict detection with simulated team scenarios
- [ ] Validate authentication handling across different Git setups
- [ ] Test network failure scenarios and error recovery
- [ ] Verify sync performance with large commit histories
- [ ] Test CLI flag combinations and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing sync command

## Version Control
- [ ] Create feature branch for remote sync development
- [ ] Commit remote fetching infrastructure separately
- [ ] Commit conflict detection logic with clear rationale
- [ ] Commit UI/UX components for conflict resolution
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation in commit messages
- [ ] Test with multiple team members before merging
- [ ] Update CLI help documentation for new flags
