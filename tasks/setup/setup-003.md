# Project Roadmap and Context for Future Development

## Context
Before context reset, establish clear project roadmap and priorities for continuing TaskGuard development through Phase 2 and Phase 3.

## Objectives
- Document current project state and architecture
- Establish clear development priorities
- Create context for resuming development
- Define success criteria for each phase

## Tasks
- [x] Phase 1 completed: Basic CLI with dependency validation
- [ ] Update README with current roadmap
- [ ] Document technical debt and known issues
- [ ] Prioritize Phase 2 features by impact
- [ ] Create development environment setup guide
- [ ] Document testing strategy
- [ ] Plan Phase 2 milestone timeline
- [ ] Identify potential blockers and risks

## Current State Summary
**✅ Phase 1 (COMPLETED):**
- Basic CLI: init, list, create, validate
- Task file format: YAML front-matter + Markdown
- Dependency blocking system working
- Multi-area organization
- Comprehensive documentation

**⏳ Phase 2 (READY TO START):**
- Git history analysis (backend-002) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Task complexity analysis (backend-003) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Sync and lint commands

**⏳ Phase 3 (DEPENDS ON PHASE 2):**
- Claude Code integration (frontend-001) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Natural language task management
- Intelligent workflow suggestions

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Start with backend-002** (Git History Analysis) - highest impact
2. **Follow with backend-003** (Task Complexity Analysis)
3. **Then frontend-001** (Claude Code Integration)
4. **Parallel testing-001** with development

## Technical Priorities
- Maintain "Developer is Captain" philosophy
- Keep CLI fast and reliable
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Focus on actionable intelligence, not automation

## Success Metrics
- Phase 2: Users get valuable insights from git analysis and linting
- Phase 3: Natural language task management feels intuitive and helpful
- Overall: TaskGuard becomes an indispensable development tool

## Updates
- 2025-09-21: Roadmap established for post-Phase 1 development
