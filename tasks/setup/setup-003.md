# Project Roadmap and Context for Future Development

## Context
Before context reset, establish clear project roadmap and priorities for continuing TaskGuard development through Phase 2 and Phase 3.

## Objectives
- Document current project state and architecture
- Establish clear development priorities
- Create context for resuming development
- Define success criteria for each phase

## Tasks
- [x] Phase 1 completed: Basic CLI with dependency validation
- [x] Update README with current roadmap
- [x] Document technical debt and known issues
- [x] Prioritize Phase 2 features by impact
- [x] Create development environment setup guide
- [x] Document testing strategy
- [x] Plan Phase 2 milestone timeline
- [x] Identify potential blockers and risks

## Current State Summary (Updated September 21, 2025)
**✅ Phase 1 (COMPLETED):**
- Basic CLI: init, list, create, validate
- Task file format: YAML front-matter + Markdown
- Dependency blocking system working
- Multi-area organization
- Comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md

**✅ Phase 2A (COMPLETED):**
- ✅ Git history analysis (backend-002) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Security audit and enhanced testing (security-001) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Sync command with intelligent status suggestions
- ✅ Comprehensive security testing framework (17 security tests)
- ✅ Git commit analysis and task correlation

**⏳ Phase 2B (READY TO START):**
- Task complexity analysis (backend-003) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Lint command for task quality analysis

**⏳ Phase 3 (READY AFTER 2B):**
- Claude Code integration (frontend-001) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Natural language task management
- Intelligent workflow suggestions

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Start with backend-003** (Task Complexity Analysis) - enables frontend work
2. **Then frontend-001** (Claude Code Integration) - depends on backend-003
3. **Parallel testing-001** with development
4. **Deployment planning** after core features complete

## Technical Priorities
- Maintain "Developer is Captain" philosophy
- Keep CLI fast and reliable
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Focus on actionable intelligence, not automation
- Security-first development (comprehensive security testing)
- Git-native operations with proper validation
- Memory safety and performance optimization

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Phase 2A: Git analysis provides valuable insights (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ Security: Comprehensive security audit completed (ACHIEVED)
- ⏳ Phase 2B: Task complexity analysis improves workflow planning
- ⏳ Phase 3: Natural language task management feels intuitive and helpful
- Overall: TaskGuard becomes an indispensable development tool

## Completed Achievements
- **29 tests passing** (12 git analysis + 17 security tests)
- **Security audit completed** with detailed vulnerability assessment
- **Git commit analysis** working with intelligent status suggestions
- **Multi-area task organization** fully functional
- **Dependency blocking system** validated and working
- **Comprehensive documentation** in CLAUDE.md for development guidance

## Updates
- 2025-09-21: Roadmap established for post-Phase 1 development
- 2025-09-21: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Updated roadmap to reflect current accurate state
  - Phase 2A complete: Git analysis (backend-002) and security audit (security-001)
  - README updated with current implementation status
  - Technical debt documented in security-report.md
  - Next priorities identified: backend-003 → frontend-001 → testing-001
  - All acceptance criteria met
