# Comprehensive Testing Suite for Phase 2-3 Features

## Context
As TaskGuard grows in complexity with git analysis and AI integration, comprehensive testing becomes critical to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

## Objectives
- Test all Phase 2 intelligence features
- Validate Phase 3 Claude Code integration
- Ensure backward compatibility with Phase 1
- Create integration tests for complex workflows

## Tasks
- [ ] Unit tests for git analysis algorithms
- [ ] Integration tests for `taskguard sync` command
- [ ] Tests for task complexity analysis
- [ ] Tests for `taskguard lint` functionality
- [ ] Claude Code integration tests
- [ ] Natural language processing tests
- [ ] Workflow simulation tests
- [ ] Performance tests with large repositories
- [ ] Edge case testing (empty repos, corrupted tasks, etc.)
- [ ] Regression tests for Phase 1 functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Coverage:**
- >90% test coverage for all new features
- All major workflows tested end-to-end
- Edge cases and error conditions covered

✅ **Integration:**
- Tests work with real git repositories
- Claude Code integration tests pass
- Performance tests meet benchmarks

✅ **Reliability:**
- Tests are deterministic and fast
- Clear error messages for failures
- Easy to run and maintain

## Technical Notes
- Use cargo test for Rust components
- Create test fixtures with git repositories
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Ensure tests can run in CI/CD environment
- Document test setup and maintenance procedures
