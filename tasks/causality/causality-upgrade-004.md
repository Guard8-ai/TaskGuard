# Update Documentation - Add Causality-Aware System Guide

## Intent
Document the causality-aware task system in AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md so AI agents understand how to use the enhanced format effectively. This enables AI agents to naturally fill in causality sections and preserve temporal context across sessions.

## Pre-Implementation Exploration
**Before coding, AI agent must explore:**
- [ ] **Horizontal scan**: Review AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md structure and style
- [ ] **Vertical scan**: Understand documentation flow (Installation ‚Üí Basics ‚Üí Advanced)
- [ ] **Git context**: Check recent documentation updates
- [ ] **Complexity check**: Will this fit in one session context?
  - ‚úÖ YES - Single documentation file update
  - Causality: Read current docs ‚Üí Add new section ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Best practices

## Implementation Context
**Files/functions this touches:**
- Primary: `AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md` - Add causality section
- Reference: CAUSALITY_AWARE_UPGRADE.md for specification
- Style: Match existing guide tone and format

**Expected changes:**
- Add "Causality-Aware Task System" section
- Document new template sections
- Provide examples of good causality documentation
- Add upgrade workflow instructions
- Include best practices for AI agents

## Expected Causality Chain
**What should happen when this works:**

1. AI agent reads AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md ‚Üí Understands causality system
2. AI creates new task ‚Üí Uses causality template naturally
3. AI works on task ‚Üí Fills in causality sections during work
4. AI completes task ‚Üí Documents session handoff
5. Next AI session ‚Üí Reads handoff ‚Üí Has temporal context
6. Temporal drift prevented ‚Üí Better code quality

**Failure modes:**
- If documentation unclear ‚Üí AI agents ignore sections ‚Üí Temporal drift continues
- If examples poor ‚Üí AI agents copy bad patterns
- If too technical ‚Üí Reduces adoption

## Current State
- [ ] Read current AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Identify insertion point for causality section
- [ ] Write causality-aware system section
- [ ] Add examples and best practices
- [ ] Add upgrade workflow
- [ ] Review for clarity and completeness

## Documentation Structure

### New Section: "Causality-Aware Task System"

**Placement:** After "Task Management Basics" section

**Contents:**
1. **Overview**: Why causality matters for AI agents
2. **Template Sections**: Explanation of each causality section
3. **Workflow**: How to use causality-aware tasks
4. **Examples**: Good vs bad causality documentation
5. **Best Practices**: Tips for effective causality preservation
6. **Upgrade Guide**: How to migrate legacy tasks

## Section Content Outline

### 1. Overview - Why Causality Matters
- Problem: Temporal drift in vibe coding
- Solution: Causality preservation in task format
- Benefits: Better context, fewer mistakes, faster work

### 2. Template Sections Explained

**Intent Section:**
- What: Document the "why" not just the "what"
- When: Always fill this when creating/starting task
- Example: Good vs vague intent

**Pre-Implementation Exploration:**
- What: Checklist to prevent jumping into coding
- When: Complete before writing first line of code
- Why: Catches complexity and causality issues early

**Implementation Context:**
- What: File paths, entry points, git context
- When: As you explore the codebase
- Why: Next session knows where to look

**Expected Causality Chain:**
- What: Document the event flow and failure modes
- When: After exploration, before implementation
- Why: Defines success criteria and testing approach

**Session Handoff:**
- What: Summary for next session/agent
- When: When marking task done
- Why: Prevents temporal causality loss

### 3. Workflow Example

**Show complete workflow from creation to completion:**
```bash
# Create task with causality template
$ taskguard create --title "Implement rate limiting middleware"

# AI agent fills sections as they work:
# 1. Read task ‚Üí See pre-implementation checklist
# 2. Explore codebase ‚Üí Fill "Implementation Context"
# 3. Document expected flow ‚Üí Fill "Expected Causality Chain"
# 4. Implement feature ‚Üí Update "Current State"
# 5. Complete task ‚Üí Fill "Session Handoff"

# Mark done
$ taskguard status done backend-001

# Next task can reference the handoff
```

### 4. Examples Section

**Good Causality Documentation:**
```markdown
## Expected Causality Chain
**What should happen when this works:**
1. Request hits rate limiter middleware ‚Üí Checks Redis for request count
2. Under limit ‚Üí Increments counter ‚Üí Proceeds to next middleware
3. Over limit ‚Üí Returns 429 Too Many Requests ‚Üí Logs violation

**Failure modes:**
- Redis connection fails ‚Üí Middleware should fail open (allow request)
- Counter increment race condition ‚Üí Use atomic INCR operation
- Clock skew between servers ‚Üí Use UTC timestamps
```

**Bad (Vague) Causality Documentation:**
```markdown
## Expected Causality Chain
The rate limiter should work.
```

### 5. Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **Fill sections during work, not after:**
   - Update "Implementation Context" as you explore
   - Document "Expected Causality Chain" before implementing
   - Complete "Session Handoff" when marking done

2. **Be specific in causality chains:**
   - Name actual functions and files
   - Include failure modes
   - Document async/event flows

3. **Use session handoffs effectively:**
   - What changed (code + runtime behavior)
   - What to verify (testing checklist)
   - What next task should know

4. **Upgrade legacy tasks opportunistically:**
   - When working on legacy task, upgrade it first
   - Fill causality sections based on exploration
   - Help improve system quality

### 6. Upgrade Workflow

**For AI agents working with legacy tasks:**

```bash
# Detect legacy tasks
$ taskguard validate
# Shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Found 13 legacy format tasks"

# Upgrade specific task you're working on
$ taskguard upgrade backend-001

# Or upgrade all at once
$ taskguard upgrade --all

# Fill in causality sections during implementation
# (sections will have AI prompts: "[AI: Document...]")
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

**Match existing guide style:**
- Clear, conversational tone
- Use examples liberally
- Include both CLI commands and explanations
- Use emoji icons sparingly but effectively (‚úÖ ‚ùå üí° ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Real-world scenarios

**Avoid:**
- Overly technical language
- Jargon without explanation
- Walls of text without examples
- Theoretical concepts without practical application

## Implementation Steps

1. **Read current guide:**
   ```bash
   cat AGENTIC_AI_TASKGUARD_GUIDE.md
   ```

2. **Identify insertion point:**
   - After "Task Management Basics"
   - Before "Advanced Features" (if exists)

3. **Write new section:**
   - Follow outline above
   - Use existing guide's style
   - Include all examples

4. **Add table of contents entry:**
   - Update TOC to include new section

5. **Review for clarity:**
   - Read as if you're an AI agent
   - Check examples are clear
   - Ensure workflow is intuitive
