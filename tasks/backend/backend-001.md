# Implement Advanced Task Complexity Analysis

## Context
With basic complexity analysis complete in backend-003, this task extends the analysis capabilities with advanced features like complexity trends, team metrics, and project-wide complexity insights.

## Objectives
- Implement complexity trend analysis over time
- Add project-wide complexity metrics and reporting
- Create complexity comparison features between areas
- Build advanced analytics for team productivity insights

## Tasks
- [x] Extend TaskAnalyzer with historical complexity tracking
- [x] Implement project-wide complexity metrics
- [x] Add complexity trend analysis
- [x] Create area-based complexity comparisons
- [x] Add advanced reporting features to lint command
- [x] Implement complexity threshold configuration
- [x] Add team productivity insights

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Advanced Analytics:**
- Track complexity trends over time
- Compare complexity across different areas
- Generate project-wide complexity reports

✅ **Enhanced Reporting:**
- Extended lint command with advanced metrics
- Configurable complexity thresholds
- Team productivity insights and recommendations

## Technical Notes
- Extends the analysis module from backend-003
- Uses existing TaskAnalyzer as foundation
- Integrates with Git history for trend analysis
- Configurable via .taskguard/config.toml

## Updates
- 2025-09-21: Task created
- 2025-09-21: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Advanced complexity analysis implemented
  - Extended TaskAnalyzer with project-wide metrics and trend analysis
  - Enhanced lint command with advanced reporting capabilities
  - Added complexity threshold configuration support
  - Implemented area-based complexity comparisons
  - All advanced analytics features working with existing backend-003 foundation
  - Task scope fulfilled by comprehensive backend-003 implementation plus extensions
