# Implement Git History Analysis

## Context
Phase 2 of TaskGuard implementation focuses on intelligence features. Git history analysis will enable smart status suggestions by analyzing commit patterns and relating them to task files.

## Objectives
- Analyze Git commit history to detect task-related activity
- Suggest status updates based on commit patterns
- Detect when tasks should be marked as completed
- Provide intelligent "what's next" recommendations

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement git2 integration for repository analysis
- [ ] Create commit message parsing for task references
- [ ] Build task-to-commit correlation engine
- [ ] Add status suggestion algorithms
- [ ] Implement `taskguard sync` command
- [ ] Add git activity reporting
- [ ] Create intelligent workflow suggestions
- [ ] Add tests for git analysis features

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Git Integration:**
- Can analyze commit history in any Git repository
- Correctly identifies task-related commits
- Handles various commit message formats

✅ **Smart Suggestions:**
- Suggests status changes based on commit activity
- Identifies stale tasks with no recent activity
- Recommends next tasks based on dependency completion

✅ **Sync Command:**
- `taskguard sync` analyzes recent activity
- Provides actionable suggestions with rationale
- Allows user to accept/reject suggestions

## Technical Notes
- Use git2 crate for repository operations
- Parse commit messages for task ID patterns (setup-001, auth-002, etc.)
- Implement heuristics for status detection (e.g., "fix tests" suggests review status)
- Ensure performance with large repositories
- Handle edge cases like rebases, merges, force pushes
