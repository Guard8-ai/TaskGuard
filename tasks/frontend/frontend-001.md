# Implement Claude Code Natural Language Integration

## Context
Phase 3 of TaskGuard focuses on Claude Code integration, enabling natural language task management. This transforms TaskGuard from a CLI tool into an AI-powered assistant.

## Objectives
- Enable natural language task creation and management
- Integrate with Claude Code's command system
- Provide context-aware task suggestions
- Implement conversational workflow guidance

## Tasks
- [ ] Design natural language parsing for task operations
- [ ] Implement Claude Code command integration
- [ ] Create context-aware suggestion engine
- [ ] Build conversational task creation flow
- [ ] Add intelligent "what's next" recommendations
- [ ] Implement natural language queries
- [ ] Create smart task breakdown from descriptions
- [ ] Add workflow guidance and best practices
- [ ] Integrate with git analysis for smart suggestions
- [ ] Add natural language dependency management

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Natural Language Commands:**
- "Create a task for user authentication" → creates properly structured task
- "Show me what I should work on next" → intelligent recommendations
- "I finished auth, what's next?" → analyzes dependencies and suggests tasks

✅ **Claude Code Integration:**
- Seamless integration with Claude Code workflows
- Context-aware responses based on project state
- Natural conversation flow for task management

✅ **Intelligence:**
- Analyzes project context for relevant suggestions
- Understands task relationships and dependencies
- Provides smart workflow guidance

## Technical Notes
- Design for Claude Code's command interface
- Use git analysis and task complexity data for suggestions
- Implement natural language understanding for task descriptions
- Ensure responses are concise but informative
- Handle ambiguous requests gracefully with clarifying questions
- Integrate with existing TaskGuard commands as backend
