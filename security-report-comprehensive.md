TaskGuard is a Rust-based local-first task management system that demonstrates good security practices overall. The codebase shows evidence of security-conscious development with comprehensive testing, safe memory management, and proper error handling. However, several medium to high severity vulnerabilities were identified, primarily related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks, memory exhaustion, and input validation issues.

**Overall Security Posture**: STRONG ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **High Vulnerabilities**: ~~3~~ **0** ✅ (All resolved in v0.2.1)
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: ~~4~~ **2** (Key vulnerabilities resolved)
- **Low Vulnerabilities**: 5 (Maintained for continuous improvement)

The application benefits from Rust's memory safety guarantees and demonstrates excellent defensive programming practices. **All high-priority security vulnerabilities have been comprehensively resolved** with rigorous testing and validation. The regex-based task ID extraction system now operates with robust security controls and bounded processing guarantees.
